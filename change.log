      Version: 0.9.0
	WARNING: You cannot do an easy upgrade because of changes in the API
        Rewrote the API to increase speed and simplicity
        6 new methods to the json object: get_keys, get_values, index_of, get(indx), check_duplicate, remove_duplicates
        New type: json_value - to hold the variables. Hooked to the printer. (anydata is now hidden away).
        Added binary support through base64 in the json_ext package
        New package json_dyn: Build json structures dynamically from selects (number, varchar2 and date fields are supported)
        Parser can now parse any valid json value: json_parser.parse_any (accepts object, array, string, number, boolean, null)
        Parserspeed has been improved
        Object procedures are now faster due to the 'in out nocopy' directive
        Cast from json_value to json or json_list in constructor
        json and json_list can be converted to json_value with the function to_json_value.
        Added 5 examples
